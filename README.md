# üñºÔ∏è AI Image Generator with Hugging Face and Streamlit

This project is a simple web-based application that allows users to generate AI-generated images using the Hugging Face Stable Diffusion model. The app is built using **Streamlit** and makes API requests to the **Hugging Face Inference API** to generate images based on user prompts.

## Features
- **Prompt-based image generation**: Users can input a creative prompt to generate a unique AI image.
- **Image download**: Once the image is generated, users can download it directly from the interface.
- **User-friendly interface**: A simple, modern design with responsive elements for a clean user experience.
